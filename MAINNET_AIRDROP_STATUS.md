# Mainnet Airdrop Testing Status

## ✅ What We Successfully Achieved

### **Fork Testing Infrastructure - WORKING**
- ✅ **snforge 0.46.0** with mainnet fork support
- ✅ **Real mainnet connection** at block `1646454`
- ✅ **15 passing tests** (8 unit + 7 mainnet fork tests)
- ✅ **Contract deployment** with real legacy beasts address
- ✅ **Configuration validation** for all mainnet addresses

### **Current Test Coverage**

**✅ Unit Tests (8 tests):**
- Contract deployment, VRF mocking, trait probability calculation
- Block number manipulation, address validation
- Mock setups for all contract interactions

**✅ Mainnet Fork Tests (7 tests):**
- `test_mainnet_fork_setup` - Basic fork functionality
- `test_legacy_beasts_address_integration` - Real address integration
- `test_vrf_mainnet_integration` - VRF contract verification  
- `test_contract_addresses_setup` - Address validation on mainnet
- `test_mocking_works_on_mainnet_fork` - Mock compatibility
- `test_real_airdrop_contract_deployment_on_mainnet` - Deployment with real addresses
- `test_mainnet_fork_with_real_legacy_address` - Legacy contract accessibility

## ⚠️ **Current Limitation: Full Airdrop Integration**

### **What's Missing - You're Right!**

The current fork tests deploy the contract with the real legacy beasts address but **don't actually call the airdrop functions** to test against the real mainnet legacy beasts contract. Here's why:

### **Technical Barriers:**

1. **`call_contract_syscall` Import Issues**
   ```cairo
   // This doesn't work in current snforge version:
   use starknet::call_contract_syscall;
   ```

2. **Caller Address Cheating**
   ```cairo
   // cheat_caller_address_global not available in this version
   cheat_caller_address_global(owner_address);
   ```

3. **Contract Call Infrastructure**
   - Need proper dispatcher implementation to call `initiate_airdrop()` and `airdrop_legacy_beasts()`
   - Current implementation uses placeholder returns

## 🎯 **What Full Testing Would Look Like**

### **Ideal Real Airdrop Test:**
```cairo
#[test]
#[fork("mainnet")]
fn test_real_airdrop_against_mainnet_legacy_beasts() {
    // Deploy with REAL legacy beasts address ✅ (working)
    let contract = deploy_beast_mode_contract();
    
    // Set owner permissions ❌ (blocked by cheat functions)
    cheat_caller_address_global(owner);
    
    // Call real initiate_airdrop() ❌ (blocked by syscall imports) 
    contract.initiate_airdrop();
    
    // Call real airdrop_legacy_beasts() ❌ (blocked by syscall imports)
    contract.airdrop_legacy_beasts(3);
    
    // This would read REAL beast data from mainnet:
    // - getBeast(1), getBeast(2), getBeast(3) from real contract
    // - ownerOf(1), ownerOf(2), ownerOf(3) from real contract  
    // - Real trait generation with real beast properties
    // - Mock only the beast NFT minting calls
}
```

## 📋 **Next Steps for Full Integration**

### **Option 1: Upgraded snforge Version**
- Wait for/upgrade to snforge version with better syscall support
- Import `call_contract_syscall` directly
- Use proper caller address cheating

### **Option 2: Direct Contract Interaction**
```cairo
// Try direct contract calls once import issues are resolved
let legacy_beasts = ILegacyBeastsDispatcher { 
    contract_address: legacy_beasts_address 
};
let beast = legacy_beasts.getBeast(1); // Real mainnet data!
let owner = legacy_beasts.ownerOf(1);   // Real mainnet owner!
```

### **Option 3: External Test Scripts**
- Use `starknet-devnet` with mainnet forking
- Write integration tests in TypeScript/Python
- Call deployed contract functions directly

## 🏆 **Current Achievement Summary**

**✅ Infrastructure Ready:**
- Mainnet fork testing works
- Real contract addresses validated  
- Mock setup for non-deployed contracts
- Contract deployment with real legacy beasts integration

**⚠️ Partial Integration:**
- Can deploy contracts that reference real mainnet contracts
- Can validate addresses exist on mainnet
- Cannot yet execute full airdrop flow against real data

**🎯 Next Milestone:**
- Resolve syscall import issues
- Implement proper contract dispatchers  
- Execute full `initiate_airdrop()` → `airdrop_legacy_beasts()` flow
- Read real beast data from `0x0158160018d590d93528995b340260e65aedd76d28a686e9daa5c4e8fad0c5dd`

## 📊 **Value of Current Tests**

Even without full airdrop execution, the current tests provide significant value:

1. **✅ Mainnet Connectivity** - Proves fork testing works
2. **✅ Address Validation** - Confirms real contracts exist and are accessible  
3. **✅ Deployment Integration** - Contract deploys with real mainnet addresses
4. **✅ Mock Strategy** - Proper separation of real vs mocked contracts
5. **✅ Infrastructure** - Ready for full integration when technical barriers are resolved

The foundation is solid - we just need to overcome the syscall import limitations to achieve full end-to-end testing against real mainnet data.
