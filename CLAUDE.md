## Commands

### Build

```bash
scarb build
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests
snforge test
# or
scarb test

# Run specific test
snforge test test_name

# Run tests with coverage
snforge test --coverage

# Check coverage percentage
lcov --summary coverage/coverage.lcov
```

### Check Code Coverage

To verify code coverage percentage:

```bash
# Generate coverage data
snforge test --coverage

# View coverage summary
lcov --summary coverage/coverage.lcov

# Enforce minimum coverage (will exit with error if below 80%)
lcov --summary coverage/coverage.lcov --fail-under-lines 80
```

This will output:

- Line coverage percentage
- Function coverage percentage

**IMPORTANT**: Before submitting a PR, ensure your code coverage is at least equal to or higher than the main branch coverage. Current baseline: 84.3% line coverage.

### Format

```bash
scarb fmt
```

## Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL: This project enforces a minimum 80% test coverage using cairo-coverage. Any code changes without adequate tests will fail CI validation.**

When implementing features:

1. Write comprehensive unit tests for all new functions
2. Include edge cases, boundary conditions, and failure scenarios
3. Add integration tests for cross-contract interactions
4. Create fuzz tests for user inputs and mathematical operations
5. Run coverage check locally before pushing

## Completion Criteria

**Definition of complete**: A task is ONLY complete when `scarb build && scarb test` runs with zero warnings and zero errors.

When encountering issues:

1. Fix warnings/errors sequentially
2. Verify each fix with `scarb build && scarb test`
3. Ensure 90%+ test coverage for modified files
5. Only consider work complete when all criteria are met

2. **Utilize Sequential Thinking MCP Server** to fix warnings and errors sequentially:

   - Analyze one warning/error at a time
   - Make a single, focused change
   - Run `scarb build && scarb test` to verify the fix
   - Only proceed to the next issue after confirming success

### Workflow checklist:

- [ ] Code changes implemented
- [ ] `scarb build` passes with zero warnings and zero errors
- [ ] `scarb fmt -w` to format the codebase
- [ ] `scarb test` passes with zero warnings and all tests green
- [ ] All unused imports removed
- [ ] All unused variables prefixed with `_` or removed
- [ ] `lcov --summary coverage/coverage.lcov` shows 80%+ coverage for project
- [ ] New tests added for any new functionality

**Do not consider any task complete until ALL criteria are met.**

## Pull Request Checklist

**NEVER create a pull request without completing ALL items:**

1. **Run all tests**: `scarb test`
   - Verify test count matches or exceeds baseline (318 passing)
   - Fix any test failures before proceeding
2. **Check build**: `scarb build`
   - Fix ALL warnings (except known contract size warnings)
   - Zero tolerance for new warnings
3. **Format code**: `scarb fmt -w`

   - Must be run before final commit

4. **Verify coverage**:

   ```bash
   snforge test --coverage && lcov --summary coverage/coverage.lcov
   ```

   - Modified files must maintain 80%+ coverage
   - Overall coverage must be â‰¥ 80% (current main branch baseline)
   - If coverage drops below baseline, add more tests before creating PR

5. **Final verification**: Run `scarb build && scarb test` one last time
   - This MUST complete with zero errors and zero new warnings

**If ANY step fails, DO NOT create the PR. Fix the issues first.**

After submitting a pull request, sleep for 5 minutes then review github actions to ensure the build and test pass. Also review and respond to all comments. If changes are warranted, push the changes, sleep for 5 minutes, then re-review. Repeat this process until all checks are passing and there are no unresolved comments.

### Honesty About Results

**ALWAYS provide honest assessment of your work:**

- If you break tests, say so clearly
- If you reduce passing test count, that's a FAILURE, not a success
- Success means: MORE passing tests, not fewer
- Better to admit failure than mislead about results
